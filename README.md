# Self reflection
## Post Mortem
*Unfortunately, it has a horrible API for RoR which is the primary reason for quitting this project.
###Lessons Learned: 
1. Put more time and effort into selecting which DBs and APIs to utilize.
2. The importance of modularity, even in something as high level as RoR.
3. Come up with OOP design before creating the models
